- Security breaches and threat detection
- Service integration failures

## Playbook Structure

All playbooks in this directory follow a consistent markdown structure:

### 1. **Title** (H1)
The playbook title describing the issue (e.g., "EC2 Instance Connection Timeout (SSH Issues)")

### 2. **Meaning** (H2)
A comprehensive explanation of what the issue means, including:
- What triggers the issue

## Usage Guidelines

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the Issue**: Match your symptoms to the appropriate playbook title
2. **Open the Playbook**: Navigate to the relevant `.md` file
3. **Follow the Playbook**: Execute the numbered steps in order, replacing placeholder values (e.g., `<instance-id>`) with your actual resource identifiers
4. **Review Diagnosis Section**: Use the correlation analysis to identify root causes
5. **Extend Time Windows**: If initial correlations don't reveal the cause, extend time windows as suggested
6. **Check Alternative Sources**: Review alternative evidence sources mentioned in the Diagnosis section

### Example Workflow

**Scenario**: EC2 instance SSH connection timeout

1. Open `Connection-Timeout-SSH-Issues-EC2.md`
2. Read the **Meaning** section to understand the issue
3. Review the **Impact** section to assess severity
4. Follow **Playbook** steps:
   - Step 1: Verify instance is running
   - Step 2: Check security group rules
   - Step 3: Verify public IP assignment
   - ... (continue through all steps)
5. Use **Diagnosis** section to correlate events:
   - Compare security group changes with connection failures
   - Check if failures began after recent changes
6. Apply the identified fix

### Common Placeholders

Playbooks use the following placeholder format that should be replaced with actual values:
- `<instance-id>` - EC2 instance identifier
- `<bucket-name>` - S3 bucket name
- `<region>` - AWS region
- `<function-name>` - Lambda function name
- `<role-name>` - IAM role name
- `<user-name>` - IAM user name
- `<security-group-id>` - Security group identifier
- `<vpc-id>` - VPC identifier
- `<rds-instance-id>` - RDS instance identifier
- `<load-balancer-name>` - Load balancer name

### Best Practices

- **Start Early**: Begin with the most common causes (earlier steps in the Playbook section)
- **Use CloudWatch Logs Insights**: Efficient log analysis for troubleshooting
- **Correlate Timestamps**: Use the Diagnosis section to correlate events with failures
- **Document Findings**: Keep notes of what you've checked and what you found
- **Consider Gradual Issues**: If immediate correlations aren't found, check for gradual degradation
- **Check AWS Service Health**: Verify if AWS service issues are affecting your resources
- **Review CloudTrail Events**: Check for configuration changes that might have caused the issue
