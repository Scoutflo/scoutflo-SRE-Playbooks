## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of AWS services or Kubernetes
- Access to AWS Console or Kubernetes cluster (for using playbooks)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Scoutflo/scoutflo-SRE-Playbooks.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd scoutflo-SRE-Playbooks

# View available playbooks
ls AWS\ Playbooks/
ls K8s\ Playbooks/
```

#### Option 2: Use as Git Submodule

Include playbooks in your own projects:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/Scoutflo/scoutflo-SRE-Playbooks.git playbooks
```

#### Option 3: Download Specific Playbooks

Browse and download individual playbooks directly from GitHub web interface.

### Quick Start

1. **Identify Your Issue**: Determine if it's an AWS or Kubernetes issue
2. **Navigate to Playbooks**: 
   - AWS issues → `AWS Playbooks/`
   - K8s issues → `K8s Playbooks/[category-folder]/`
3. **Find the Playbook**: Match your symptoms to a playbook title
4. **Follow the Steps**: Execute diagnostic steps in order
5. **Use Diagnosis Section**: Apply correlation analysis for root cause identification

### Example Usage

**Scenario**: EC2 instance SSH connection timeout

1. Navigate to `AWS Playbooks/`
2. Open `Connection-Timeout-SSH-Issues-EC2.md`
3. Follow the Playbook steps, replacing `<instance-id>` with your actual instance ID
4. Use the Diagnosis section to correlate events with failures
5. Apply the identified fix

## Usage

### Playbook Structure

All playbooks follow a consistent structure:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive issue identification
2. **Meaning** - What the issue means, triggers, symptoms, root causes
3. **Impact** - Business and technical implications
4. **Playbook** - 8-10 numbered diagnostic steps (ordered from common to specific)
5. **Diagnosis** - Correlation analysis framework with time windows

### Best Practices

- **Start Early**: Begin with the most common causes (earlier steps)
- **Replace Placeholders**: All playbooks use placeholders (e.g., `<instance-id>`, `<pod-name>`) that must be replaced with actual values
- **Follow Order**: Execute steps sequentially unless you have strong evidence pointing to a specific step
- **Correlate Timestamps**: Use the Diagnosis section to correlate events with failures
- **Extend Windows**: If initial correlations don't reveal causes, extend time windows as suggested
- **Document Findings**: Keep notes of what you've checked and what you found

### Placeholder Reference

**AWS Playbooks:**
- `<instance-id>`, `<bucket-name>`, `<region>`, `<function-name>`, `<role-name>`, `<user-name>`, `<security-group-id>`, `<vpc-id>`, `<rds-instance-id>`, `<load-balancer-name>`

**Kubernetes Playbooks:**
- `<pod-name>`, `<namespace>`, `<deployment-name>`, `<node-name>`, `<service-name>`, `<ingress-name>`, `<pvc-name>`, `<configmap-name>`, `<secret-name>`
